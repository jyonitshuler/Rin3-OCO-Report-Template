# Introduction
As the [Annie E. Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/) [KIDS COUNT](https://ourchildrenoregon.org/our-work/research-data/#kids-count) organization for the state of Oregon, [**Our Children Oregon**](ourchildrenoregon.org) produces a variety of reports on various subject matters of the time as well as the annual KIDS COUNT report card on childrens' well-being. Given the plethora of data and research on children and families, it is imperative that we, as an organization, have report templates off of which we can nimbly prepare dissemination of the latest and most pertinant information relevant to these populations. These can include:
- summations of reports from other child welfare organizations, both in Oregon and nationally
- explanations of recent legislation tied to OCO's [**2021 Children's Agenda**](https://ourchildrenoregon.org/our-work/policy-advocacy/#childrens-agenda)
- explanatory reports on the sources/importance of the six indicator series of our **KIDS COUNT** annual publications: *Demographics*, *Family Supports*, *Economic Well-being*, *Education*, *Health*, and *Family & Community*)
